Everyone makes mistakes, and it's a common reaction to want to avoid consequences or difficult conversations.\n\nIt might be helpful to think about why you felt the need to hide it. Sometimes, when we break something, we worry about how others will react, or we might be upset with ourselves.\n\nWould you like to talk more about how this is making you feel? Or perhaps we could explore some ways to manage these kinds of feelings when they come up?\n\nUpcoming event: 'Evening Mindfulness Circle' – Online, Oct 25, 7 PM CST." ]
